Quick Reference
===============

Sometimes, after not using a particular command or technology for a while, I find that I'm re-googling the same syntax questions and viewing the same stackoverflow answers I did last time. I also have years of code snippets in text files in my home directory. This quickref repo is attempt to give myself one quick and easy place to go to, or grep, when I can't remember exact option I'm looking for. Maybe you'll find it useful too.

All examples use:
  - server server01
  - node node01
  - namespace/project ns01
  - user user01
  - pod pod01
